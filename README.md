#Welcome to the repository of **EEBG-2024** laboratory Works!#
The 6 given assignments at **The Third Edition of EEBG, 2024**, held from June 25th to June 28th. This educational initiative is tailored for students and early-career researchers interested in the expansive fields of bioinformatics, big data, data-driven science, high-performance computing (HPC) and now, notably, cloud computing.<br/> This github repository is structured into *three* directories, those being **summarydata**, **notebook** and **figure**, each with their own README file for further explanations.
